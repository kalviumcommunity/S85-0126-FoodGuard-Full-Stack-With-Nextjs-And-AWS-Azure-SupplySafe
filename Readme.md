# Digital Food Traceability System for Indian Railway Catering Services

## Problem Statement
Indian Railway Catering Services face persistent **food safety and hygiene complaints** due to the absence of a **digital traceability mechanism**.  
Suppliers are often **untracked**, records are **manual**, and there is no real-time visibility into the food supply chain.  
This makes it difficult to ensure hygiene compliance, identify responsibility during complaints, and enforce regulatory standards.

---

## Project Objective
The objective of this project is to design a **digital, end-to-end food traceability and compliance system** that ensures:
- Complete transparency of food supply chain
- Hygiene and safety compliance
- Supplier accountability
- Faster complaint resolution
- Improved passenger trust

---

## Proposed Solution Overview
The proposed system digitally tracks food throughout its lifecycle:

**Supplier → Ingredient Batch → Kitchen → Transport → Train → Passenger**

Each stage is digitally recorded, monitored, and verified using QR codes, cloud dashboards, and automated compliance checks.

---

## Key System Components

### 1. Supplier Registration & Verification
- Digital onboarding of suppliers
- FSSAI license verification
- Hygiene certification uploads
- Geo-location tagging
- Automatic license expiry alerts

---

### 2. Ingredient Batch Tracking
- Each ingredient assigned a unique batch ID
- Batch details include:
  - Source supplier
  - Manufacturing/harvest date
  - Expiry date
  - Storage requirements

---

### 3. QR Code-Based Traceability
- QR codes attached to food packets or catering units
- Scanning displays:
  - Ingredient source
  - Kitchen details
  - Cooking time
  - Transport history

---

### 4. Real-Time Monitoring Dashboard
- Centralized dashboard for railway authorities
- Tracks:
  - Supplier compliance status
  - Hygiene audits
  - Temperature logs
  - Violation alerts

---

### 5. Hygiene & Storage Monitoring
- Digital hygiene checklists
- IoT-based temperature and humidity tracking
- Automatic alerts for unsafe conditions

---

### 6. Passenger Feedback Integration
- QR-linked complaint system
- Complaints mapped directly to:
  - Supplier
  - Batch
  - Kitchen
- Enables quick isolation of unsafe food batches

---

### 7. Compliance & Reporting Automation
- Auto-generated compliance reports
- Monthly hygiene scorecards
- Supplier performance ranking
